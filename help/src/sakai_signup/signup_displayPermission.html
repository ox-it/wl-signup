<h2>Sign-up tool:&nbsp; Participation, permissions and display</h2>

<p>
<strong>Views</strong>:&nbsp; Different views may be chosen in the
drop-down list on the Meetings page, showing meetings over different
time spans, meetings for which the user has already signed up, or meetings available for sign-up.&nbsp;
Recurring meetings may be shown in the list with a plus sign adjacent to
the name, which may be clicked to open the list and show the recurrences.&nbsp;
All are shown thus if the “Expand all recurring meetings” box is
checked.
</p>

<p>The Meetings table, by default, shows the list of meetings by
ascending date and time.&nbsp; The table may be re-ordered by clicking
on a column heading for the item of interest. &nbsp;Clicking on “Meeting Title,”
for instance, shows the list in alphabetical order, with all meetings
of the same title, on different dates and times, grouped together.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Viewing and adding participants</strong>: &nbsp;To see the list of participants who have signed up for a meeting,
click its title to reveal the Meeting Details page.&nbsp; The names of those
signed up will appear in the Participants column of the timeslots table, adjacent to
the time slots they chose.&nbsp; A red “delete” button and a
pencil-and-pad “edit” button, which allows that participant to be
replaced with another, appears next to each name.&nbsp; The appearance
of a small blue bubble icon to the right of the name means that the
participant has added a comment at the time of sign-up, which can be
seen by clicking on that icon.</p>
<p>In addition to
the voluntary sign-up action taken by participants, a meeting organizer
may add participants manually.&nbsp; To do so, click the
“Add Participant” link and select names or groups from the drop-down
list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <strong>Group membership</strong>: &nbsp; If you selected the option to create a group for each timeslot when you created the meeting, a "Group Membership" column will appear on Meeting Details. As participants sign up, cancel, or are moved into the participant list from the Wait List, you need to click on the &quot;Synchronise&quot; button to synchronise the corresponding internal subgroup stored in Site Info. </p>

<p>
<strong>Permissions</strong>:&nbsp; The set of permissions applies to
the use of the Sign-up Tool across the site, not to any particular
meeting. &nbsp;Permissions can be granted,
by role, with an interface for doing so that resembles that of other
tools.&nbsp; The “Permissions” link shows, &nbsp;for each realm of
grouping— (1) <em>site</em> (all members), and (2, 3, ...) <em>group</em>,
for each group defined on that site, a labelled button that leads to
an authorization matrix.&nbsp; For groups that do not include the site
organizer as a member, the group button is not active in the
Permissions settings and the site organizer cannot adjust the settings.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Only certain permissions in certain contexts are meaningful.&nbsp;
The privilege “create.site” addresses creation of new meetings, so, if
that box is checked in the “access” row, representing users with
student status, students will have the “Add” link on their
Meetings page.&nbsp; If “create.site” is not checked for the access
role, but “create.group” is checked in the
“access” row for a site group (defined in Site Info), then student
members of that group will have the “Add” link, and be able
to create meetings, for that group only.&nbsp; If groups are defined,
the “view” and “attend” permissions must be checked for
that group realm, as stated on screen, in order for group members to
sign up.&nbsp; No adjustment will allow the Sign-up button to appear
for meeting organizers.&nbsp; For more details, contact your system administrator.
</p>
<!-- We think this para is now unnecessary since Oxford made the Schedule tool always present for Signup (behind the scenes)
<p>
<strong>Listing on the Schedule or Calendar tool</strong>
:&nbsp; If you create a meeting without the Schedule tool on the
site, but add the Schedule tool later, you can add each meeting
individually to the Schedule’s calendar:&nbsp; In the Sign-Up tool, click on the
meeting name, click the “Modify” option at the top, then find and click
on the option “Show other default settings.”&nbsp; That
will allow you to choose to publish the meeting to the Schedule.&nbsp;
Repeat for all other meetings that you want on the Schedule.
