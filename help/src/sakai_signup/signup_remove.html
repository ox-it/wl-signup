Sign-up tool:&nbsp; Remove meeting(s)
</h2>

<p> The Meetings page shows all the site&rsquo;s meetings in  table format including title, location, date, time, and so forth.  They can   be ordered with the column headings and filtered with the &ldquo;View&rdquo;   selection box.  Recurring meetings, those created as a set with a single   title, can be expanded or contracted with the checkbox. </p>

<p>
  <strong>To remove a meeting:&nbsp;</strong> <br>
  Check the &quot;Remove&quot; checkbox alongside the meeting you wish to remove, then click the &quot;Remove Meetings&quot; button.</p>
<p>You will receive a confirmation message: &quot;Are you sure you want to permanently remove the meeting(s)?&quot;. Select &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;.</p>
<p>You can also remove an entire  series of recurring meetings. Uncheck the box &quot;Expand all recurring meetings&quot;. This provides the collapsed view. Check the 
&quot;Remove&quot; checkbox alongside the series you wish to remove, then click the &quot;Remove Meetings&quot; button.</p>
<p>Participants who have signed up for the meeting will receive an automatic email notification that the meeting has been cancelled.
