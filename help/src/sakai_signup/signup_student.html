<h2>
Sign-up tool: Students (participants) - How to sign up
</h2>

<p>
If your instructor is using the Sign-up tool you will see it listed on the left side of the page.
</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Sign-up</strong> and from the View drop-down menu, you can choose "view meetings 
I am signed up for" or "meetings available for sign-up."&nbsp; The latter view will also show 
those that you have signed up for already.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the Sign-up tool, you will see a Meetings screen listing the meetings that your instructor has created. Select the relevant meeting by clicking on its title. If the sign up period is open, you can click on the button
labelled “Sign-up” beside the timeslot of your choice. If a “Meeting
Status” message shows that the sign up period is not yet open to sign-up, note
the beginning sign-up time shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>If the meeting is full and
your instructor has enabled the Wait List option, you will be able to add your
name to the Wait List. If space becomes available, you will be automatically added to the
list of attendees, and notified by email.</li>
<li>If your instructor has enabled it, you will
  see a comment field where you can type a message, which is seen only by
  the instructor.&nbsp; </li>
<li>If a lock icon appears in Meeting Details next to a timeslot, 
your instructor has removed that timeslot from further sign-up.</li>
<li> After you have signed up to a timeslot, you should receive an email confirmation containing a calendar entry. If you accept the appointment, it will be added to your personal calendar.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
  <p>You may cancel any appointment you have signed up for, within the
time period allowed by your instructor, by clicking the Meeting Title,
then <strong>Cancel Sign-up</strong>. If the sign up period has ended, this cancel button will not appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the instructor's discretion, you may be able to see the names of other participants who have already signed 

up.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can select to "View Meetings I am Signed up for". You can also use the "Export" link to export this information to a spreadsheet.
</p>
</li>
